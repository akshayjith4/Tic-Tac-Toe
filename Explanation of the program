The TicTacToe class represents the game itself. It has methods for initializing the game, printing the board, checking for available moves, checking for empty squares, counting empty squares, making a move, and checking for a winner.

The print_board method prints the current state of the board to the console.

The print_board_nums method prints the indices of the board, allowing players to know which number corresponds to which square. This is useful for guiding players on which input to provide.

The available_moves method returns a list of indices of empty squares on the board.

The empty_squares method checks if there are any empty squares left on the board.

The num_empty_squares method returns the number of empty squares left on the board.

The make_move method allows a player to make a move on the board. It checks if the selected square is empty and updates the board accordingly. If the move results in a win, it sets the current_winner attribute.

The winner method checks if the latest move resulted in a win. It checks rows, columns, and diagonals to determine if there is a winner.

The play function orchestrates the game. It alternates between the two players, allowing each player to make a move until either one wins or the game ends in a tie.

The HumanPlayer class represents a human player. It prompts the user for input to make a move, ensuring that the input is valid (an integer between 0 and 8 corresponding to an empty square on the board).

In the __main__ block, two instances of HumanPlayer are created for 'X' and 'O' players respectively. Then, a TicTacToe instance is created, and the play function is called to start the game.

You can run this code to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in the console. Each player will take turns entering their moves until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
